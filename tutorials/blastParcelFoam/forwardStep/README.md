# blastParcelFoam forwardStep tutorial

## Notes

This is a modified version of the standard forwardStep tutorial from OpenFOAM. The case has been modified to include inertial, heated, Lagrangian particles.

To view the case the standard OpenFOAM paraview reader must be used. Because decomposed cases cannot be viewed with this reader the case is reconstructed on the simulation is complete.

The case takes approximately 30 min to run on a four-core desktop.
