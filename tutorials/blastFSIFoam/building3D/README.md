# Building 3-D with FSI tutorial

## Notes

This case is designed to show a simple 3-D case setup using an STL file with snappyHexMesh and adaptive mesh refinement. The a c-4 charge placed inside a L-Shaped building. The c-4 is activated using the linear activation model. This cases also uses fluid structure interaction. The blastFSIFoam solver is still under development and changing the case setup may result in crashes.


The case takes approximately 5 min to run on a four-core desktop.
