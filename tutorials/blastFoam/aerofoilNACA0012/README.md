# Oblique shock tutorial

## Notes

This is a modified version of the OpenFOAM aerofoildNACA0012 tutorial used to show the use of turbulence models and tracer particles. The tracers must be viewed with the standard OpenFOAM paraview reader (-builtin will not work). Because blastFoam only supports transient simulations, the case will not reach steady state due to long run times.

The case takes approximately 10 min to run on a single-core desktop.
