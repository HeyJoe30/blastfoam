# Delayed detonation tutorial

## Notes

This is a simple case to show how to setup a case using delayed activation of points. A RDX charge is used with six activation point, with four of the six using a delayed start. A linear activation model is used, but the same setup of the detonation points can be applied to any of the other available models.

This case takes approximately 2.5 min to run on a single core desktop.
