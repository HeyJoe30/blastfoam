# Air blast with QBMM diameter model tutorial

## Notes

The OpenQBMM library is required to run this case

This is case is designed to show the coupling to the OpenQBMM library. The charge uses an Arrhenius rate reaction dependent on the size distribution represented by quadrature based moment methods

The case takes approximately 1 hr to run on a four-core desktop.
