# blastPbeTransportFoam forward step tutorial

## Notes

This is a modified version of the standard forwardStep tutorial from OpenFOAM. The case has been modified to include non-inertial particles which have a continuous size distribution represented using quadrature based moment methods.

The case takes approximately 2 hrs to run on a four-core desktop.
