# blastPbeTransportFoam forward step tutorial

## Notes

This is a modified version of the standard forwardStep tutorial from OpenFOAM. The case has been modified to include non-inertial particles which have a continuous size distribution represented using quadrature based moment methods. The particle size distribution will changed due to aggregation and breakup. Turbulent diffusion is also included.

The case takes approximately 45 min to run on a four-core desktop.
