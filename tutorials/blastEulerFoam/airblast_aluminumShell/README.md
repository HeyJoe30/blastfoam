# Air burst with aluminum shell

## Notes

This case is used to show the capability of blastFoam to handle energy release from a solid, granular phase using a Arrhenius rate reaction. A constant diameter is used to represent the aluminum phase, with a surface temperature from the surrounding gas phase.


The case takes approximately 1.5 min to run on a four-core desktop.
