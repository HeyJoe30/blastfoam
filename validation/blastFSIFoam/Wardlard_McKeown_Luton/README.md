# Underwater detonation and FSI using the Tillotson equation of state Validation

## Notes

This case is that of Wardlaw et al. (1998) and is used to validate the Tillotson equation of state and the fluid structure interaction solver. This case will not produce correct results currently due to the fact that the necessary plastic deformation models are not yet implemented. The blastFSIFoam solver is still under development. However this case will be used to validate its implementation.

The calculation took approx. 4 hrs to run on a single core laptop at the reference resolution (e.g. 64x288 cells) and a maximum refinement level of 2.
